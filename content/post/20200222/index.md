My paper "Deep material network with cohesive layers: Multi-stage training and interfacial failure analysis" has just been published in *Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering*. A Share Link with 50-day free access is provided:

A few highlights of this work:

- New architecture of material network enriched by adaptable cohesive networks.

- Physics-based building block with a length parameter to describe the size effect.

- Multi-stage training strategy to reduce the number of fitting parameters at each stage.

- Extrapolation of enriched DMN from linear elasticity to nonlinear failure analysis.
