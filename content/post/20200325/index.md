For the first time, we coupled deep material network with macroscale finite element model in LS-DYNA for concurrent multiscale simulations.

The integrated data-driven framework is currently applied to the short fiber reinforced composite, and we are expecting more systems to be targeted.

A nice collaborative work from the team!
