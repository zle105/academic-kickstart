abstract: "A data-driven mechanistic modeling technique is applied to a system representative of a broken-up inclusion (“stringer”) within drawn nickel-titanium wire or tube, e.g., as used for arterial stents. The approach uses a decomposition of the problem into a training stage and a prediction stage. It is applied to compute the fatigue crack incubation life of a microstructure of interest under high-cycle fatigue. A parametric study of a matrix–inclusion–void microstructure is conducted. The results indicate that, within the range studied, a larger void between halves of the inclusion increases fatigue life, while larger inclusion diameter reduces fatigue life."
