abstract: "The advent of advanced processing and manufacturing techniques has led to new material classes with complex microstructures across scales from nanometers to meters. In this paper, a data-driven computational framework for the analysis of these complex material systems is presented. A mechanistic concurrent multiscale method called Self-consistent Clustering Analysis (SCA) is developed for general inelastic heterogeneous material systems. The efficiency of SCA is achieved via data compression algorithms which group local microstructures into clusters during the training stage, thereby reducing required computational expense. Its accuracy is guaranteed by introducing a self-consistent method for solving the Lippmannâ€“Schwinger integral equation in the prediction stage. The proposed framework is illustrated for a composite cutting process where fracture can be analyzed simultaneously at the microstructure and part scales."
