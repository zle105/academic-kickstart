**Innovative light-weight design** led to a new generation of energy efficient and cost-effective vehicles. It is estimated that every 10% reduction in vehicle weight can cut fuel consumption by about 7% for traditional vehicles. For electric cars, light-weight structure can reduce the electric propulsion due to low battery capacity and low excitation of power traction. 

Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) composites have been identified as a key enabling technology to reduce energy consumption with a high strength-to-weight ratio of structural property for modern light-weight vehicle design. On the other hand, CFRP fabrication methods such as **injection molding, compression molding and thermoforming** require expensive facilities and equipment which cause high costs and long process cycles in comparison to well-established metal fabrication processes. 

Therefore, a framework that provides the knowledge of structure-property relationship for CFRP products becomes the key to the success of green and light-weight vehicle design. **A few types of CFRP composites of interest are listed below**,

- Unidirectional fiber composite
- Woven composite
- Short fiber composite
- Long fiber composite

A detailed study on unidirectional fiber composite and woven composite can be found in our [2019 JMPS paper]({{< ref "/publication/liu-2019-exploring/index.md" >}}). In particular, a three-scale material model is realized by the concatenation of the material network for each composite.
