Deep material network uses a collection of connected simple building blocks with analytical homogenization solutions to describe complex overall material responses. 
By discovering a proper topological representation of RVE with fewer degrees of freedom, this intelligent material model is believed to open new possibilities of high-fidelity efficient concurrent simulations for a large-scale heterogeneous structure. 
It also provides a mechanistic understanding of structure-property relations across material length scales and enables the development of parameterized microstructural database for material design and manufacturing.
