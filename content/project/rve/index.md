Materials are hierarchical in nature. The macroscopic material properties are strongly affected by the morphology and evolution of the microstructures, especially under extreme events with large material deformations and geometric nonlinearities. The representative volume element (RVE) techniques based on homogenization theory are a type of hierarchical multi-scale simulation methods offering the numerical constitutive relationship at the macroscopic point.
