I am a senior research scientist at Livermore Software Technology Corporation (LSTC), interested in the emerging area among computational mechanics, material physics and machine learning. My research goal is to develop theories and methods for solving challenging multiscale and multiphysics problems in modern materials engineering and advanced manufacturing. 

My recent work on deep material network presents a new way of embedding physics into the building block of a network-based machine-learning model for large-scale multiscale simulation and materials design. All fitting parameters are interpretable with physical meanings, enabling the extrapolation of learned model.  Its efficiency and accuracy has been validated on various material systems with highly nonlinear behaviors. More details can be found in my lectures in [USNCCM15 short course]({{< ref "/talk/2019usnccmSC/index.md" >}}).
