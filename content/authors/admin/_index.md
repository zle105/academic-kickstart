I am a senior research scientist at Livermore Software Technology in the emerging area among **computational mechanics**, **material physics**, and **machine learning**. My research is centered on developing theories and methods to solve challenging multiscale and multiphysics problems in modern materials engineering and advanced manufacturing. 

My recent work on **deep material network** presents a new way of embedding physics into a network model for large-scale multiscale simulation and materials design. The key features are the physics-based building block with interpretable fitting parameters, extrapolation capability for material and geometric nonlinearities with only linear elastic training data, and efficient online inference. More details can be found in my lectures for [USNCCM15 short course]({{< ref "/talk/2019usnccmSC/index.md" >}}).
